## 2. Current decisions

### D-015 Separate language files are mandatory

English and Simplified Chinese documentation are maintained as separate files. Existing documents keep their established language; missing counterparts are added without changing the original document's primary language. Both versions are updated in the same commit.

### D-016 Preserve the mixed WORKLOG as an immutable archive

The former `docs/WORKLOG.md` mixed English and Chinese history. JAI-047 preserves its exact bytes under `docs/archive/` and starts new active English and Simplified Chinese logs. The archive is historical evidence and must not receive new entries.

### D-017 Migrate legacy documents in bounded Issues

JAI-047 covers the planning/backlog mirrors, bilingual indexes, and WORKLOG split needed to make the new policy executable. Remaining legacy single-language documents are inventoried and assigned to JAI-048; they are not rewritten opportunistically in feature Issues.

## 3. Active work history

### 2026-08-14 — JAI-046 bilingual documentation and Git identity rules completed

- Verified the handoff branch `feature/jai-046-bilingual-docs-git-identity` at `29071dff1a80d26bac892d7bce548cf593c78eec`; the worktree was clean and the branch was not yet merged into `develop`.
- Verified JAI-037 was merged at `c649862`, `main` remained at `e72f50e`, and `develop` had no divergence from its cached tracking reference.
- Verified repository-local and global Git authorship as `user9527448 <2537759248@qq.com>`; no prior commit or author history was rewritten.
- The first quality-gate run passed Ruff and Mypy and 83 non-database tests, but skipped six PostgreSQL tests because Docker was not running; coverage was 83.06%, below the 85% gate.
- After Docker Desktop was started, the database-enabled gate passed: Ruff format/lint, Mypy, all 89 tests, and 88.35% coverage.
- Merged JAI-046 into `develop` with non-fast-forward merge `f07b6d5` and pushed normally. Local HEAD, `origin/develop`, and GitHub `ls-remote` all matched `f07b6d50ed9abda08d38883eefa3904b98b99455`.

### 2026-08-14 — JAI-047 bilingual documentation migration baseline started

- Created `feature/jai-047-bilingual-docs-migration` from synchronized `develop` commit `f07b6d5`; no work started from `main` or an unmerged feature branch.
- Inventory found that `docs/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`, `docs/GITHUB_ISSUES.md`, and the mixed-language `docs/WORKLOG.md` have no independent English/Simplified Chinese pair, while several other repository-authored documents remain legacy single-language files.
- Scope is limited to registering JAI-046 through JAI-048, adding English mirrors for the substantively updated plan and backlog, splitting the active work log without losing history, and synchronizing the bilingual indexes.
- The legacy WORKLOG was copied byte-for-byte to `docs/archive/WORKLOG-LEGACY-THROUGH-JAI-046.md`; source and archive SHA-256 both equal `E9CB9D3652A065491F5C88D3D24610A0593B6079AA49353A912F8B40B9E9A0F7`.
- No application code, source adapter, database schema, network collection behavior, or deferred technology is in scope.
- Added reciprocal English/Simplified Chinese mirrors for the development plan, Issue backlog, and active WORKLOG; both documentation indexes now separate paired documents, the immutable archive, and the JAI-048 inventory.
- Structural verification passed: plan headings 45/45, backlog headings 70/70, active-log headings 13/13, index headings 5/5, and identical JAI identifier order in both backlogs.
- Relative-link verification checked 35 Markdown files with no broken links. `git diff --check` passed, and the archive SHA-256 remained unchanged.
- Database-enabled final gate passed: Ruff format checked 94 files, Ruff lint passed, Mypy passed across 56 source files, all 89 tests passed, and coverage was 88.35%.
- The first staged `git diff --cached --check` found four trailing-space lines in the new English plan header. PowerShell continued to the local commit despite that non-zero native-command result; the commit had not been pushed. The four lines were corrected immediately and a separate scoped fix commit was prepared without rewriting history.

## 4. Verification and blockers

- JAI-046 final gate: Ruff format/lint passed; Mypy passed across 56 source files; 89 tests passed with PostgreSQL; coverage 88.35%.
- JAI-046 push verification: local `develop`, `origin/develop`, and `git ls-remote --heads origin develop` matched `f07b6d50ed9abda08d38883eefa3904b98b99455`.
- One pre-push read-only GitHub check failed during a temporary port 443 outage; the later normal push and explicit `ls-remote` verification succeeded.
- JAI-047 verification passed: 35 Markdown files had no broken relative links; bilingual heading and Issue-ID parity passed; `git diff --check` passed; Ruff format/lint, Mypy, all 89 PostgreSQL-enabled tests, and 88.35% coverage passed.
- Pre-push formatting correction: four staged trailing-space findings in `docs/en-US/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` were removed; final staged and worktree diff checks must pass before push.

## 5. Next actions

1. Commit and normally push the verified JAI-047 branch, then merge it into `develop`.
2. Confirm local `develop`, `origin/develop`, and GitHub `ls-remote` agree.
3. Resume the planned product sequence with JAI-012 from the latest synchronized `develop`.
4. Execute JAI-048 as a separate documentation Issue; do not mix broad legacy-document migration into JAI-012.
